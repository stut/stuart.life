## Who are you?

My name is Stuart and I am alive, for now. This site is here to catalogue my efforts to stay that way. My _challenges_ include:

* Being overweight.
* Having type II diabetes.
* Having high blood pressure.
* Having chronic kidney disease thanks to not controlling my diabetes for many, many years.

### Why publish this data?

In the past I've found that putting these things out in public motivates me to do the things it takes to keep the numbers--and by extension my health--under control.

I've also found that having a record of these numbers is extremely valuable both for me and for the medical professionals who help look after me. It helps me spot trends and anomalies, and seeing the results of the work I'm doing, whether positive or negative, creates a critical feedback loop.

### Can I contact you?

Certainly. The best way to get in touch is either via <a href="https://twitter.com/stut">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stuartdallas">Facebook</a>.

### How does this site work?

The site is maintained using Jekyll with a custom stylesheet and some custom plugins to create the graph data and archives. You can <a href="https://github.com/stut/stuart.life">see the source on Github</a>.
